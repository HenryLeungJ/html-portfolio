<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Megamind</h3>
<p>Megamind is a story about a misunderstood super villian that was just not given the resources needed to become a
    superhero, thus he turned to a road of villany. This movie embodies struggles that happen in the real world in a cartoonish
    and outlandish way but still protrays the problems with impact.

<h3>The Incredibles</h3>
<p>This movie is many people's childhood favourite. Superpowers, relatable heroes, and relatable villians. What more do you need?</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</h3>
<p>I've been a big anime fan for quite a while now. Jujutsu Kaisen is a top tier anime in both plot and action scenes. This movie did
    wonders for the anime world.
